- 💰 **What products are most often sold together?**
  
  As observed in the image, product combos are consistently purchased together. To maximize sales, we will bundle high-demand products with lower-selling items or offer discounts on combo purchases.

-  🔎 **What product sold the most ?**

As observed in the image, price significantly impacts product sales. For example, the MacBook Pro and ThinkPad laptops have the highest prices, leading to lower order quantities. In contrast, AA and AAA batteries, which have the lowest prices, are among the best-selling products.
