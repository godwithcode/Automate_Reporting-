# Automated Revenue Reporting

## Overview

This project automates revenue reporting using Python. It leverages Pandas for data processing and Matplotlib for visualization, making revenue tracking and analysis more efficient. The automation ensures accuracy, reduces manual effort, and provides meaningful insights into revenue trends.

## Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language for automation.

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib: Data visualization and charting.

CSV/Excel: Data input format.

Jupyter Notebook / Script: Execution environment.

## Project Objectives

Automate revenue data processing: Load, clean, and aggregate revenue data.

Generate insights: Calculate key revenue metrics (total revenue, growth rate, top-performing products, etc.).

Create visualizations: Generate revenue trend charts and summaries.

Export reports: Save processed data and graphs into a report format (CSV, Excel, or PDF).
